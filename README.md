Bamazon Manager View App

This Node application is modeled after an Amazon-like storefront that uses MySQL, and it does the following:
It lists a set of menu options:
1) View Products for Sale
2) View Low Inventory
3) Add to Inventory
4) Add New Product

If a manager selects View Products for Sale, the app lists every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.
If a manager selects View Low Inventory, then it lists all items with an inventory count lower than five.
If a manager selects Add to Inventory, the aspp displays a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.
If a manager selects Add New Product, it allows the manager to add a completely new product to the store.

You can watch a demo of how the app works on the following link:
